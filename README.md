# Iris-Flower-Species-Classification

Project Title: Iris Flower Species Classification
Introduction
The "Iris Flower Species Classification" project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks and is a classic example in the field of machine learning.

Problem Statement
The problem addressed in this project is to create a reliable and accurate classification model that can automatically determine the species of Iris flowers based on their physical attributes. The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, as well as species labels for three different Iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing
The project started with data exploration, including the examination of data samples, checking for missing values, and identifying duplicate records. The dataset was found to be clean and ready for analysis.

Feature engineering was performed to create additional features such as petal area, sepal length squared, and petal width cubed. Categorical features, such as "species" and "sepal_length_category," were encoded using label encoding to prepare them for modeling.

Modeling
Feature Matrix and Target Variable
The feature matrix (X) was defined to include the selected attributes, excluding the target variable "species_encoded." The target variable (y) was set to "species_encoded," representing the encoded species labels.

Model Selection
A Random Forest Classifier was selected as the machine learning algorithm for this classification task. Random Forest is known for its robustness and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data.

Model Training and Evaluation
The data was split into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test) to train and evaluate the model. The Random Forest Classifier was trained on the training data, and its performance was evaluated on the test data. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 93% on the test set, indicating its ability to classify Iris flowers accurately.

Additionally, cross-validation was performed to ensure the model's consistency and generalization across different data subsets. The mean cross-validation accuracy was found to be approximately 94.53%, supporting the model's robustness.

Further Analysis
The project also included additional analysis steps:

Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix was used to examine false positives and false negatives, providing insights into the model's performance for each Iris species class.

Feature Importance: Feature importance analysis revealed which attributes had the most significant influence on the model's predictions. This insight can aid in understanding the factors contributing to species classification.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the "Iris Flower Species Classification" project successfully developed a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying Iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal measurements. The model demonstrated strong performance, achieving an accuracy of approximately 93% on the test set and maintaining a mean accuracy of approximately 94.53% during cross-validation.

This classification model has practical applications in botany, species identification, and automated classification tasks. It serves as an excellent example of utilizing machine learning to solve real-world classification problems.
